= eSelling Project

This Vaadin-Quarkus-based project tracks personal items that I am trying to sell.

It began life as a collision between a Gemini-built main View
and the canonical Vaadin/Quarkus starter app.

Run using `mvn` or `mvn quarkus:dev`

Open http://localhost:8080/[] in browser.

To run locally in production mode, call `mvn package -Pproduction` 
and then
`java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`

== TODO

Add fields:
	Category?
	Photos!?

=== Longer-term:

	Add ability to list items from the app's data via REST.
